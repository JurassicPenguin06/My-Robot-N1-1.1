# My-robot-N1
I want to build a robot in which I will mix almost all the things I have learned at school and by myself

DOCUMENTATION ON GOOGLE DRIVE: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1FN25gbB0lYeTK5rmA5BDILMUsb7AlmWU?usp=sharing


Roadmap:

-Obtaining the needed components in order to start building the robot- COMPLETED

-Testing the motors through the motor driver TB6612FNG- COMPLETED

-Testing the optocouplers, useful for getting extra data from the motors/wheels...- COMPLETED

-Testing the IR reflective sensor for the line following ability-

-Testing PID control-

-Testing the MP3 reader and the speakers (to give sound effects to the robot)

-Testing the "distance sensor"

-Testing the robotic arm 

-Testing the MPU-6050/GY-521

-"from breadboard to matrix board"

-a name for the robot

-other ideas coming soon...
